## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, helping businesses understand customer preferences and optimize their service offerings. Key insights are drawn from session ratings, order frequency, and demographic factors.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **UserID**: Unique identifier for the user
- **User Name**: User's name
- **Age**: User's age
- **Location**: User's location
- **Registration Date**: Date when the user registered
- **Phone**: User's phone number
- **Email**: User's email address
- **Favorite Meal**: User's favorite meal
- **Total Orders**: Total number of orders placed by the user
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for each cooking session
- **Cooking Dish Name**: Name of the dish cooked in the session
- **Session Start & End**: Start and end time of the cooking session
- **Duration (mins)**: Duration of the cooking session in minutes
- **Session Rating**: Rating given by the user for the session
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed
- **Order Dish Name**: Name of the dish ordered
- **Order Status**: Status of the order (Completed/Cancelled)
- **Amount (USD)**: Total cost of the order
- **Time of Day**: Time when the order was placed (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- **Rating**: Rating given for the ordered dish
- **Age Group**: Age group of the user (e.g., 20-30, 30-40)

## Analysis Summary

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned by removing duplicates, converting date columns into proper datetime format, and handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA was performed to understand the distribution of key variables such as age, orders, session duration, ratings, etc.
- **User Demographics Analysis**: Insights were gathered based on the age group, location, and preferred meals of the users.
- **Session Analysis**: A detailed analysis was performed to evaluate user sessions, including session duration, ratings, and their relation to orders placed.
- **Order Analysis**: The most ordered dishes, session ratings, and dish popularity were analyzed.
- **Correlations**: Correlation between different features (e.g., session ratings, order amount, and total orders) was examined to uncover potential business patterns.

## Key Insights

- **User Behavior**: Most users fall within the age group of 30-40, with a balanced distribution across other age groups.
- **Popular Dishes**: Certain dishes have higher order frequencies, while others are less popular.
- **Session Ratings**: High session ratings are positively correlated with higher order amounts, suggesting that better cooking sessions lead to higher customer satisfaction and more orders.
- **Peak Times**: Orders are higher during evenings, indicating that users prefer to place orders after work hours.
- **Order Status**: Most orders are successfully completed, with a small percentage of cancellations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for data processing, analysis, and visualization
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and documentation
